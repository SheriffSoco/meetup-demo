# Meetup Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this repository

This is a project that comes from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/). It is a website to create and favorite meetups. Data for meetups are saved to a Firebase Realtime Database. The database was created with test permissions, meaning there is no code for database authentication. Additionally, the URL used for REST API calls has not been obscured (oops).

To run this webapp, download the repository and, with node.js installed, run `npm start`. Additionally, ensure that you have created a Firebase Realtime Database, that the database has test permissions set, and that the database URL is included in the code.
